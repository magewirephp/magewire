## Installation
```
composer require magewirephp/magewire
```

Please be aware that this extension is primarily build for themes running without Require JS like Hyvä Themes. It will
not work with RequireJS-dependent Magento theme out of the box. Don't worry – with a few simple tweaks, you can unleash
most of the richness in your Blank or Luma projects. Head over to the [compatibility](./docs/Compatibility.md) section
to learn more and start making your Magento 2 store more dynamic and engaging today!

## Developers say
- **Marcus Venghaus — Freelance Developer** — This is a game-changing tool! You can build practically anything with almost no javascript. It saves a significant
amount of time and is incredibly easy to work with. It's not a matter of whether you should use it, you simply must
use it.

- **Vinai Kopp — Technical Director** — Magewire is like magic sauce that can save a ton of time implementing features! It’s great to see more tools from the
Laravel ecosystem being made available within Magento

- **Jesse de Boer — Frontend Developer** — Magewire gives you the ability to add reactivity without the use of a a bloated JS framework or package. Useing Magewire
is intuitive, quick and easy to learn. It feels like a breath of fresh air to work with and takes away a lot headaches
compared to using Luma and RequireJS.

- **Kiel Pykett — Technical Lead** — Magewire is one of my favourite tools! It even makes frontend morons like me capable of dynamic UIs! More people should
check it out. 

## More
Creating layers of abstraction and tools to simplify complex situations for other developers is a major source of motivation for me.
It's one of the reasons I love what I do. Each of my code repositories aims to achieve this. Take a look at my other repositories - they might be helpful for you.

_This Magewire port would not have been
possible without the the existence of the [Laravel Livewire](https://laravel-livewire.com/) project, it's creator [Caleb Porzio](https://github.com/calebporzio) and all contributors
with their tireless efforts and dedication. A big shoutout and thank you to all of them for the inspiration and
motivation to make this work in- and outside the Laravel ecosystem! :heart: :heart:_
