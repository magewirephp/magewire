Magewire is a [Laravel Livewire](https://laravel-livewire.com/) port for Magento 2. The goal is to make it fun and easy
to build modern, reactive and dynamic interfaces, without leaving the comfort of Magento's core layout and template
systems. Magewire can be the missing piece when you intend to build dynamic and reactive features, but don't require
working with a full JavaScript framework like Vue or React.

## Installation
```
composer require magewirephp/magewire
```

Magento theme out of the box. Go and check out the [compatibility](./docs/Compatibility.md#magewire---compatibility)
section to enable all the Magewire richness in your Blank or Luma projects.
