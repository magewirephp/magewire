Magewire is a [Laravel Livewire](https://laravel-livewire.com/) port for Magento 2. The goal is to make it fun and easy
to build modern, reactive and dynamic interfaces, without leaving the comfort of Magento's core layout and template
systems. Magewire can be the missing piece when you intend to build dynamic and reactive features, but don't require or
feel comfortable working with a full JavaScript framework like Vue or React.

## Installation
```
composer require magewirephp/magewire
```
Magewire is a [Hyva Themes](https://hyva.io/) first Magento 2 extension and won't work on a RequireJS dependent
Magento theme out of the box. Go and check out the [compatibility](./docs/Compatibility.md#magewire---compatibility)
section to enable all the Magewire richness in your Blank or Luma projects.

> This Magewire port would not have been
possible without the the existence of the [Laravel Livewire](https://laravel-livewire.com/) project, it's creator [Caleb Porzio](https://github.com/calebporzio) and all contributors
with their tireless efforts and dedication. A big shoutout and thank you to all of them for the inspiration and
