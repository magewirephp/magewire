## Updates
I've decided to move away from X (formerly Twitter). Going forward, all updates will be shared exclusively on Discord while I search for a platform that is both popular among developers and suitable for sharing technical updates.

#### Magewire V3
After over a year of working on Magewire V3, the release is finally approaching. While there are still some key technical decisions to be made, once they’re resolved, nothing will stand in the way of the first alpha release.

I've been sharing more in-depth videos on my [personal YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@wpoortman) and invite you to check them out if you're interested.

In the meantime, I’m looking to expand the V3 team with passionate contributors willing to invest their time and become core contributors. There are opportunities at all levels—from writing tests and documentation to ensuring feature compatibility.

If you're interested, feel free to reach out to me on Discord or LinkedIn.

## Installation
```
composer require magewirephp/magewire
```

Please be aware that this extension is primarily build for themes running without Require JS like Hyvä Themes. It will
not work with RequireJS-dependent Magento theme out of the box. Don't worry – with a few simple tweaks, you can unleash
most of the richness in your Blank or Luma projects. Head over to the [compatibility](./docs/Compatibility.md) section
to learn more and start making your Magento 2 store more dynamic and engaging today!

## Testing

Playwright is being used to End 2 End test. You need a working Magento environment with the [Magewire Examples](https://magewire-magento.test/magewire/examples) installed. If you have that, you can run tests like this:

```bash
npm ci
npx playwright install --with-deps

# Change the URL to your Magento environment
BASE_URL=http://localhost:8080/ npx playwright test
```

## Sponsors
Based on proven results, using Magewire consistently reduces work hours, offering significant benefits to agencies,
their developers and merchants. I extend my heartfelt appreciation to my current sponsors for their support creating
a win-win situation for all involved.

## Developers say
- **Marcus Venghaus — Freelance Developer** — This is a game-changing tool! You can build practically anything with almost no javascript. It saves a significant
amount of time and is incredibly easy to work with. It's not a matter of whether you should use it, you simply must
use it.

- **Vinai Kopp — Technical Director** — Magewire is like magic sauce that can save a ton of time implementing features! It’s great to see more tools from the
Laravel ecosystem being made available within Magento

- **Jesse de Boer — Frontend Developer** — Magewire gives you the ability to add reactivity without the use of a a bloated JS framework or package. Useing Magewire
is intuitive, quick and easy to learn. It feels like a breath of fresh air to work with and takes away a lot headaches
compared to using Luma and RequireJS.

- **Kiel Pykett — Technical Lead** — Magewire is one of my favourite tools! It even makes frontend morons like me capable of dynamic UIs! More people should
check it out. 

## More
Creating layers of abstraction and tools to simplify complex situations for other developers is a major source of motivation for me.
It's one of the reasons I love what I do. Each of my code repositories aims to achieve this. Take a look at my other repositories - they might be helpful for you.

_This Magewire port would not have been
possible without the the existence of the [Laravel Livewire](https://laravel-livewire.com/) project, it's creator [Caleb Porzio](https://github.com/calebporzio) and all contributors
with their tireless efforts and dedication. A big shoutout and thank you to all of them for the inspiration and
motivation to make this work in- and outside the Laravel ecosystem! :heart: :heart:_
